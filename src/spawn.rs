//! Spawn requests: the stepwise/replay driver's unit of work.
//!
//! Each request carries a DETERMINISTIC id derived from its position in the run
//! structure (unit id + stage/role + attempt) - never wall clock, randomness, or an
//! in-memory counter - so a step process that re-runs the conductor over recorded
//! history computes the SAME id for the SAME spawn and matches a recorded result
//! back to the call that produced it, across process boundaries (§4, spec 04).
//!
//! A request also carries everything the thin native driver needs to actually run
//! the agent: the grounded task `prompt`, the agent's `system_prompt` (its persona /
//! role instructions), its `model` alias, its granted `tools`, its working `dir`,
//! and the `unit` id + `stage` for the per-unit progress label the driver builds.
//!
//! When a step reaches an UNRECORDED spawn at the frontier it PARKS the call: the
//! request is persisted to the run's event log as a [`TYPE_SPAWN_REQUESTED`] event
//! (this module owns that serialization). The replay driver reads them back with
//! [`recorded`] to answer already-recorded spawns from the log, and the spawn-budget
//! breaker counts those same DISTINCT requests (via [`recorded`], deduped by id - a
//! re-parked id is never double-counted) - so both derive from the log rather than
//! process memory, and the breaker binds across every step process the run spans.
//!
//! This is DISTINCT from `driver::workflow::SpawnRequest`, the in-process MCP
//! driver's wire type: that path (the shim) keeps working unchanged, while this
//! vocabulary is what the stepwise `rigger step` / `rigger result` surface persists.
